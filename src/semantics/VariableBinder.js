 *
 * function f(x) { var y; f(); }
 *
 * Then a set containing only {@code "x"} and {@code "y"} is returned. Note
 * that we treat {@code "f"} as free in the body of {@code f}, because
 * AlphaRenamer uses this fact to determine if the function name is shadowed
 * by another name in the body of the function.
 *
 * <p>Only identifiers that are bound <em>throughout</em> the
 * specified tree are returned, for example:
 *
 * function f() {
 *   try {
 *   } catch (x) {
 *     function g(y) { }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Reports nothing as being bound, because {@code "x"} is only bound in the
 * scope of the catch block; {@code "g"} is let bound to the catch block, and
 * {@code "y"} is only bound in the scope of {@code g}.
 *
 * {@code "arguments"} is only reported as bound if it is
 * explicitly bound in the function. If it is not explicitly bound,
 * {@code "arguments"} is implicitly bound during function
 * invocation.
