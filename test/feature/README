This directory contains the "feature" tests. Each script here is a Traceur
script that uses a feature and then validates its behavior. These scripts can
be executed by running "/test/alltests.html" or "node testfeature.js"

If any of the first lines of a feature script starts with "// Should not
compile." then that script intentionally contains an error that should *not*
successfully compile. The test harness will validate that attempting to compile
it generates an error. By convention, feature scripts like this are named
starting with "Error_".

If any of the first lines of a feature script starts with "// Skip." we ignore
the test.

If any of the first lines of a feature script starts with "// Async." there
will be a global function called 'done' that is expected to be called when the
test is done.

If any of the first lines of a feature script starts with "// Only in browser."
we ignore the test if it is run using the Node.js test runner.

If any of the first lines of a feature script starts with "// Options: " the
rest of that line is treated as a command line. The options is set as if passed
on the command line.
