This directory contains the "feature" tests. Each script here is a Traceur
script that uses a feature and then validates its behavior. These scripts can
be executed by running "/test/featuretests.html".

If the first line of a feature script starts with "// Should not compile."
then that script intentionally contains an error that should *not*
successfully compile. The test harness will validate that attempting to
compile it generates an error. By convention, feature scripts like this are
named starting with "Error_".
